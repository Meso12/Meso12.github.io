     <p>  Visual analytics is a combination of <b> automated analysis and interactive visualisations</b>. The goal of visual analytics are Visual analytics is essential in the application of physics and
          astronomy where large information spaces have to be processed and analysed. It can help determine the on-going progress of an emergency and identify the next countermeasures.
          With the help of Visual analytics people can create a tool which will help them to analyze big data and came up with 
          <i><u> synthesized information.</i></u> Visual analytics can also be used as a technique to discover unexpected phenomena while
          detecting the expected. It also help us to gather a timely and understandable assessment</p> 
		  <p>To gain a better understanding and knowledge from data, <b> human interaction </b> needs to be coupled with automatic and visual analysis method. This combination is called Visual analytics process. Heterogeneous data sources are processed first in many application scenarios. This step include preprocess and transform of the data. Then next step is choosing between visual and automatic analysis methods.
One basic characteristics of the visual analytics process is alternating between <mark>visual and automatic methods.</mark> It gives us a continuous refinement and verification of the data which leads to reach a preliminary results. If automatic analysis is performed first, models of the original data are generated using data mining methods. After that the analyst interact with the data to evaluate and refine the model with the help of visualization. On the other hand, if visual data analysis is held first, analyst use an automated analysis to confirm the generated hypotheses. To reveal insightful information about the data user interaction with the visualization is very essential. Data analysis will be very effective if the user were able to gain sufficient information from the data on demand by analyzing the data according to it value of interest, relevance, interaction model. In summary, in the visual analytics process, knowledge can be gained from visualisation, automatic analysis, aswell as the preceding interactions between visualisations, models, and the human analysts.
Obstacles come from the fact that <u> datasets are often very large and growing incrementally</u>.
